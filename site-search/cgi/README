LemurCGI
(C) 2006 - The Lemur Toolkit (www.lemurproject.org)
Version 5.0
March 4th, 2006

This is the LemurCGI package.

----------------------

To build from the makefiles (typically for Linux or Mac OS X):
1) Run "./configure -with-lemur=[LEMUR_INSTALL_DIRECTORY]"
   where [LEMUR_INSTALL_DIRECTORY] is the path to your local
   Lemur Toolkit installation (/usr/local/lemur by default)

2) Run "make".

3) Copy all the contents of the ./bin folder to the location accessible via
   your webserver. Be sure that your webserver configuration will allow
   executables to be run. Consult your webserver documentation or system
   administator if you are uncertain how to ensure this.

----------------------
   
To build from Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003 (Version 7.1):

1) Open the file "Lemur.sln" in your compiler.

2) Right-click on the LemurCGI project and open the "Properties" dialog box.

3) Under "C/C++ / General", set the additional include directories to
   reference the include directories where you have your copy of the Lemur
   Toolkit installed
   
4) Under "Linker / General", set the additional library directories to
   reference your compiled static libraries for the Lemur Toolkit.
   
5) Press "OK" to exit the properties dialog.

6) Press Ctrl-Shift-B (Build Solution) and allow the project to build.

7) Copy the created executable (LemurCGI.exe, typically found in your
   ./Debug folder, or ./Release if built in release mode) along with the
   entire contents of the ./bin folder  to the location accessible via
   your webserver. Be sure that your webserver configuration will allow
   executables to be run. Consult your webserver documentation or system
   administator if you are uncertain how to ensure this.

----------------------   

Before the initial execution, edit the "lemur.config" file (which should stay
in the same directory as lemur.cgi) to reflect your configuration. 

See the ./bin/lemur.config file for an example configuration.

The configuration file is a well-formed XML file with the opening tag
<lemurconfig>. There are two required elements within the configuration file:

<templatepath>: this should reflect the path (either relative or absolute) to
                the template files.

<indexes>: this section contains information about what indexes are available,
           and can contain as many indexes as needed. For each <index> item,
           there should be two elements. First, a <path> element must be set
           pointing at where the index is located. Secondly (and optionally),
           a <description> tag can be set to be a description of the pointed
           index.

           optionally, for an <index> item, you can specify an additional 
           parameter <queryserver> to specify the host and port of an Indri
           Daemon server to call to processes queries. For example:
           <queryserver>127.0.0.1:8900</queryserver> 
           would call the Indri Daemon on the local host at port 8900. Note
           that this will only affect queries. Any other data (cached versions
           of documents, corpus statistics, etc.) will still be gathered from
           the index <path>.
           
There is also an optional element <rootpaths> that defines if the original
path in the search result exists, then to strip it out of the URL. This is
most useful for enabling a site-search capability where there are locally 
mirrored versions of the indexed web pages. For example, if your local cache
of your website is at "/var/cache/mirrored_site/", if you do not have the
LemurCGI set to strip paths, the original URLs displayed would include the
prefix "/var/cache/mirrored_site/" in front of every result.

Also, there is an element, <supportanchortext> that can be set to true to
also include support for retrieval of inlinks if you have used the 
harvestlinks program to gather these from your corpus.

If you wish to use the default HTML templates, no modifications are
necessary, but if you want to modify the HTML templates for your own uses,
be sure to read the "README_Templates.txt" file for instructions on
available commands that you can use within the templates.
