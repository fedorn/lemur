1. run configure in the main lemur directory. Provide
   --with-site-seed=hostname to specify the host to use as a
   seed. Alternatively, after running configure, manually edit the file
   seeds.txt, inserting one hostname per line. configure will create the
   files site-search/build.param, site-search/crawl-index, and
   site-search/seeds.txt.

2. Run make in the lemur source tree (if necessary).

3. The script crawl-index will create a directory named crawl within the
   site-search subdirectory of the lemur source tree. The location to
   build in will become a parameter later. The script will then run
   heritrix in the crawl subdirectory, placing the trecweb format data
   files in the corpus subdirectory. When the crawler has finished,
   harvestlinks will run over the files in corpus, generating inlink
   data in the linkz subdirectory. When harvestlinks has finished,
   IndriBuildIndex will run, using the build.param file and default
   stopwords. The output index with be placed in crawl/index/crawl. The
   script will chmod the index to be world readable. The index can be
   moved before use.

4. The php/cgi bits will come later. 

The heritrix crawler (http://crawler.archive.org) has been modified to
include the TrecWebWriterProcessor to emit trecweb formatted
documents. Full documentation/source, available via the website.
