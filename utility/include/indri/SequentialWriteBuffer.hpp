     * Wraps an instance of indri::file::File, and provides buffering support.
     * This class works much like the BufferedWriter class in Java; every write
     * is stored in a memory buffer until that buffer fills, then the data is
     * transferred to disk en masse.
     *
     * There are at least two good reasons to buffer data before writing.  The
     * first is to avoid system call overhead for little tiny writes.  If this
     * is all you care about, you can keep this write buffer fairly small; 
     * perhaps a few kilobytes.
     *
     * However, a write buffer can also keep the disk from seeking unnecessarily
     * if you're writing to a few files simultaenously.  For this kind of
     * application, consider using a megabyte or so.  This also helps
     * keep file fragmentation down.
