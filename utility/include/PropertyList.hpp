        parsing and tokenization.  The PropertyList class is expected
        to "own" and provide memory management of properties stored
        in its list.  The setProperty function should copy the 
        Property name/value into its own internal Property object.
        Calls to nextElement and getProperty should not create
        new Property objects, but reuse the internal objects.
        On destruction of the PropertyList, the object should free
        any Property objects the PropertyList has created.
