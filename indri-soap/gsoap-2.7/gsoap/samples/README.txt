
GSOAP APPLICATION EXAMPLES

To build the example services and clients, run 'make' in the 'samples'
directory. The concurrent server examples require the Pthreads library. The SSL
example requires OpenSSL. The webserver example also requires Zlib.

LIBRARY AND GSOAP PLUGIN SUPPORT

Some of the examples require the following support libraries and plugins:

plugin/threads.h/.c       MS Windows threads and Posix threads wrapper
plugin/cacerts.h/.c       Hard-coded SSL public certificates
plugin/wsaapi.h/.c        WS-Addressing plugin
plugin/wsseapi.h/.c       WS-Security plugin

DISCLAIMER

WE DO OUR BEST TO PROVIDE YOU WITH REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES BUT WE CANNOT GUARANTEE
THAT ALL CLIENT EXAMPLES CAN CONNECT TO THIRD PARTY WEB SERVICES WHEN THESE
SERVICES ARE DOWN OR HAVE BEEN REMOVED.

MAC OS X XCODE PROJECTS

A Mac OS X Xcode project example is included in samples/calc_xcode.

MS VS2005 PROJECTS

A Visual Studio 2005 project example is included in samples/calc_vs2005. A
custom build step is defined for the gSOAP header file calc.h. The custom build
step invokes soapcpp2 to generate the source code for the project. Note that
the step to obtain the gSOAP header file calc.h is intentionally omitted, e.g.
wsdl2h is not part of this process. It is advised to run wsdl2h manually and
try various wsdl2h options and typemap.dat definitions to customize the wsdl2h
output.

SSL WITH OPENSSL

To try the SSL-secure SOAP server, install OpenSSL and change the occurrences
of "linprog2.cs.fsu.edu" in sslclient.c and sslserver.c to the machine name
(or machine IP) you are using. Example .pem files are included but you need to
create your own .pem files (see OpenSSL documentation).

The sslclient and sslserver codes can then be build as follows:

soapcpp2 -c ssl.h
gcc -DWITH_OPENSSL -o sslclient sslclient.c stdsoap2.c soapC.c soapClient.c -lssl -lcrypto
gcc -DWITH_OPENSSL -o sslserver sslserver.c stdsoap2.c soapC.c soapServer.c -lssl -lcrypto -lpthread
