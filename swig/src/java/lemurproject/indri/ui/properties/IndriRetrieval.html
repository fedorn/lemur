<h1>Indri Retrieval UI Help</h1>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>RetUI is a GUI based indri retrieval application. After opening an
index or index server, enter your query in the "Enter your query" field
and either click Search or press enter to run your query. You can change
the number of documents returned in the "Number of documents" field. The
retrieved documents will be listed in the lower table.
</p>
<p> The "Database(s)" list shows all open indexes and index servers. If
you want to remove an index or server, select it in the list (left click
with your mouse) and then select "Remove Selected Index" from the File
menu.
</p>
<p> Selecting a document (left click with the mouse) in the lower table
will raise the document display window. The document display window
contains two panes. The top displays the query tree, the bottom displays
the document text. Search terms from the query are highlighted in red in
the document text. Initially, all matches from the query are
highlighted. Selecting different nodes within the query tree will update
the highlighting to reflect the selected node only. 
</p>
<p>
If you receive a status message of the form "Out of Memory. Unable
to open document" when selecting a document from the table, you will
need to manually run java on the RetUI.jar file with addtional arguments
to increase the memory available to java. The java virtual machine can
run out of available memory when retrieving the text of large
(multi-megabyte) documents. From a command prompt window,
run:<br>
<tt>javaw -Xmx512M -jar "C:\Program Files\Indri\lib\RetUI.jar"</tt>
<br>
where -Xmx specifies the maximum memory for java to use, 512 megabytes
in the above example. If javaw is not found on your path, you will need
to have windows search for javaw.exe. If you installed indri in a
different location from the default, adjust the pathname to the jar file accordingly.
</p> 
<p> The document display window provides a File menu with the following
items: </p>
<dl>
  <dt><b>View as HTML<br>
    </b></dt>
  <dd>Pops up a new window with the current document text rendered as
  HTML. Note that hyperlinks can not be followed in this view. If the
  current document does not contain HTML markup, the view will be the
  plain text with all of the whitespace squeezed. </dd>
  <dt><b>View Original<br>
    </b></dt>
  <dd>If your computer is running Windows, and if the current document
  was indexed from a local file on your computer, and it is a Word
  (doc), PowerPoint (ppt), or Adobe PDF (pdf) format document, the
  original document can be viewed with the corresponding program, if it
  is installed on your system. The
  program will remain running, even if you exit the Retrieval UI.</dd>
</dl>

<p> Selecting the "Clear" button will clear the query, document list,
and document display window.
</p>

<p> Selecting the "Show Scores" button will enable display of query
scores in the results table. The button will then change to "Hide
Scores". Selecting "Hide Scores" will disable the display of query
scores in the results table.
</p>
